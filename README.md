# Dropshiplogic
 
This project was to make an app that will read orders from eBay and Amazon seller account, extract the SKU and place them automatically on vendors website. When the orders in vendors website is processed, the app should collect the tracking numbers and add them back to eBay/Amazon original orders. It should also calculate profits and expenses on daily and monthly basis.
